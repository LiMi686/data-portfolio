### [Pandemic Analysis (-R)](Data%20Visualization/Poster%20presentation_R/3_Diseases%20_writeup.pdf)

Processed and analyzed global WHO datasets across 200+ countries to examine infection and mortality trends. Built interactive geographic heatmaps using ggplot2 and Shiny for spatiotemporal analysis, and applied web scraping (rvest) to study correlations between media coverage and case growth.

<u>Airbnb Database Design & SQL Implementation (-R)</u>
</a>
</h3>

In this project I designed and implemented a fully normalized relational database system modeling Airbnb’s core business operations, including users, listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and insurance workflows. I developed an ER model and translated it into 20 SQL tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and bridge relationships to ensure data integrity. I formulated 10 real-world business questions and wrote corresponding SQL queries to address revenue analysis, platform risk, booking behavior, and listing performance insights.
