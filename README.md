- **Online Retail Data Mining Analysis (Dec 2024):**  
  Analyzed transaction data from an online retailer by applying anomaly detection using the IQR method to identify extreme values and irregular pricing. Leveraged Apriori-based association rule learning to uncover strong product associations.

- **NYC Parking Ticket Dataset Analysis (Apr 2023):**  
  Explored the NYC parking ticket dataset to uncover trends in parking violations, fine distributions, and geographic hotspots across the city. Utilized Python libraries for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights from complex urban data.

- **Seattle Paid Parking Analysis (Mar 2023):**  
  Analyzed Seattle's paid parking data to evaluate patterns in parking occupancy and revenue. Developed interactive dashboards to communicate key findings, providing recommendations for optimizing urban parking management.
