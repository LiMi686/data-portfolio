### [Pandemic Analysis -R](Data%20Visualization/Poster%20presentation_R/3_Diseases%20_writeup.pdf)

Processed and analyzed global WHO datasets across 200+ countries to examine infection and mortality trends. Built interactive geographic heatmaps using ggplot2 and Shiny for spatiotemporal analysis, and applied web scraping (rvest) to study correlations between media coverage and case growth.

### [Airbnb Database Design -MySQL](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/tree/main/Airbnb%20Relational%20Database%20Design%20and%20SQL%20Implementation)

In this project I designed and implemented a normalized relational database modeling Airbnb’s marketplace operations. I built an ER model and translated it into 20 SQL tables with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity. I also defined 10 real-world business problems and developed SQL queries to generate revenue, risk, and performance insights.
