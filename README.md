# Hi there, I'm LI MI ðŸ‘‹

As a Data Science student at the University of Arizona, I am passionate about applying data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. I have gained valuable experience through internships at Usher Technologies INC and the University of Arizona Cancer Center, where I worked on projects involving earthquake damage detection and lung cancer research. I have also developed skills in SQL, medical data interpretation, and data analysis. I am eager to continue learning and applying my skills in the field of data science.

## ðŸš€ Projects

- **Neural Network Architecture Comparison (Mar 2025):**  
  Designed and compared multiple neural network architectures using TensorFlow/Keras across various datasets (including Adult, UCI HAR, and del.icio.us). Fine-tuning experiments led to significant improvements, such as reducing the RMSE on the Auto MPG dataset from 8.2 to 4.0 and boosting the UCI HAR model's accuracy from 18.2% to 80.9%.

- **Pandemic Analysis (Jan 2025):**  
  Processed and aggregated extensive WHO datasets to create dynamic stream graphs visualizing time-series trends and mortality rates. Developed interactive geographic heatmaps with ggplot2 and Shiny to enable spatiotemporal analysis, and used web scraping with the rvest package to examine the correlation between media coverage and infection rates.

- **Online Retail Data Mining Analysis (Dec 2024):**  
  Analyzed transaction data from an online retailer by applying anomaly detection using the IQR method to identify extreme values and irregular pricing. Leveraged Apriori-based association rule learning to uncover strong product associations.

- **NYC Parking Ticket Dataset Analysis (Apr 2023):**  
  Explored the NYC parking ticket dataset to uncover trends in parking violations, fine distributions, and geographic hotspots across the city. Utilized Python libraries for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights from complex urban data.

- **Seattle Paid Parking Analysis (Mar 2023):**  
  Analyzed Seattle's paid parking data to evaluate patterns in parking occupancy and revenue. Developed interactive dashboards to communicate key findings, providing recommendations for optimizing urban parking management.
