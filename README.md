### [Data-Driven Seismic Damage Detection for Buildings](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20%26%20Engineering%20Diagnostics/USHER_TIME%20SERIES%20AND%20REGRESSION.ipynb)

I applied statistical modeling to evaluate structural integrity by analyzing frequency shifts before and after a strong earthquake using monitoring data. I performed exploratory analysis, peak detection, and segmented the dataset into pre- and post-earthquake periods. I implemented time series models to assess deviations in post-event behavior. The predictions indicated no significant structural damage, consistent with field survey and measurement results.

### [Pandemic Visualization & Analysis by R](Data%20Visualization/Poster%20presentation_R/Poster.png)

Processed and analyzed global WHO datasets across 200+ countries to examine infection and mortality trends. Built interactive geographic heatmaps using ggplot2 and Shiny for spatiotemporal analysis, and applied web scraping (rvest) to study correlations between media coverage and case growth.

### [Airbnb Relational Database Design -MySQL](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/tree/main/Airbnb%20Relational%20Database%20Design%20and%20SQL%20Implementation)

This is a group project, we designed and implemented a normalized relational database modeling Airbnb’s marketplace operations. I built an ER model and translated it into 20 SQL tables with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity. we also defined 10 real-world business problems and developed SQL queries to generate revenue, risk, and performance insights.

### [Cloud-Based E-Commerce Customer Analytics](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/a09adf2a03e7079cc4601f360b9f157b49339a93/Cloud-Based%20E-Commerce%20Customer%20Analytics/Project%20Report.pdf)

In this project, we developed a cloud-based customer analytics pipeline using Snowflake and Python to analyze e-commerce behavioral data. After performing feature engineering and aggregating customer-level metrics, we applied RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to identify customer segments. The resulting clusters provide insights into spending patterns, satisfaction levels, and delivery performance.

### [Online Retail Association Rule](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/41ece1ea2d61fd26dceacbc1e90ea13e9c5f8fc0/Data%20Mining_ML/Association%20Rule%20Learning%20with%20Apriori%20(1).ipynb)

I implemented association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and co-purchasing patterns in transactional retail data. By computing Support, Confidence, and Lift, I quantified product relationships and generated data-driven insights for bundling and cross-selling strategies.
