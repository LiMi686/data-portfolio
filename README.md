# Data Science Portfolio – Li Mi

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my Achievements, skills, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.

### [Data-Driven Seismic Damage Detection for Buildings](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20%26%20Engineering%20Diagnostics/USHER_TIME%20SERIES%20AND%20REGRESSION.ipynb)

I applied statistical modeling to evaluate structural integrity by analyzing frequency shifts before and after a strong earthquake using monitoring data. I performed exploratory analysis, peak detection, and segmented the dataset into pre- and post-earthquake periods. I implemented time series models to assess deviations in post-event behavior. The predictions indicated no significant structural damage, consistent with field survey and measurement results.

### [Pandemic Visualization & Analysis by R](Data%20Visualization/Poster%20presentation_R/Poster.png)

Processed and analyzed global WHO datasets across 200+ countries to examine infection and mortality trends. Built interactive geographic heatmaps using ggplot2 and Shiny for spatiotemporal analysis, and applied web scraping (rvest) to study correlations between media coverage and case growth.

### [Airbnb Relational Database Design -MySQL](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/tree/main/Airbnb%20Relational%20Database%20Design%20and%20SQL%20Implementation)

This is a group project, we designed and implemented a normalized relational database modeling Airbnb’s marketplace operations. I built an ER model and translated it into 20 SQL tables with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity. we also defined 10 real-world business problems and developed SQL queries to generate revenue, risk, and performance insights.

### [Cloud-Based E-Commerce Customer Analytics](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/a09adf2a03e7079cc4601f360b9f157b49339a93/Cloud-Based%20E-Commerce%20Customer%20Analytics/Project%20Report.pdf)

In this project, we developed a cloud-based customer analytics pipeline using Snowflake and Python to analyze e-commerce behavioral data. After performing feature engineering and aggregating customer-level metrics, we applied RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to identify customer segments. The resulting clusters provide insights into spending patterns, satisfaction levels, and delivery performance.

### Micro Projects 

  - [Neural Network Architecture Comparison](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/f9199c4b003225146c2d75aa29d6b970c8117262/Neural%20Network_Tensorflow/Architecture%20Comparison/Readme.md): compare multiple neural network architectures, including deep vs. wide networks, ReLU vs. tanh activation functions, dropout vs. non-dropout networks, and early stopping vs. non-early stopping strategies.

  - [Multi-label Text Classification](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/8595a480de9aa7b6eba78521614f3012ce01c98b/Distilroberta_hands%20up/README.md): I implemented a multi-label text classification pipeline using the DistilRoBERTa transformer model with 85% accuracy. 

  - [Classification Model Benchmarking in R](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/cfad5a1059dd3f25d3ea4c3b5583b019d714a1c3/Data%20Mining_ML/SVM,KNN,Decision%20Trees,%20RandomForest.R): Implemented a supervised learning pipeline in R using the Titanic dataset, benchmarked KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models to compare classification performance.

  - [Web Scraper (R)](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/297972f3982b32cf801443426a7a445d73cf1248/Data%20Mining_ML/R_Web%20Scraper.R): Implemented a simple data scraping workflow in R, including scraping and structured data storage.
