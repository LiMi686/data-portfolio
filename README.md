# Data Science Portfolio – Li Mi

This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my Achievements, skills, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.

### [Data-Driven Seismic Damage Detection for buildings]    ([https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20%26%20Engineering%20Diagnostics/USHER_TIME%20SERIES%20AND%20REGRESSION.ipynb](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20%26%20Engineering%20Diagnostics/USHER_TIME%20SERIES%20AND%20REGRESSION.ipynb))

In this project, I applied statistical modeling to evaluate structural integrity by analyzing frequency shifts before and after a strong earthquake using high-rise monitoring data. I conducted exploratory analysis, peak detection, and segmented the data into pre and post-earthquake periods. I implemented linear regression and autoregressive (AR) time series models to assess deviations in post-earthquake behavior. The prediction indicated no significant structural damage, the result also aligned with the data obtained from field surveys and measurements.

### [Pandemic Analysis -R](Data%20Visualization/Poster%20presentation_R/3_Diseases%20_writeup.pdf)

Processed and analyzed global WHO datasets across 200+ countries to examine infection and mortality trends. Built interactive geographic heatmaps using ggplot2 and Shiny for spatiotemporal analysis, and applied web scraping (rvest) to study correlations between media coverage and case growth.

### [Airbnb Database Design -MySQL](https://github.com/LiMi686/data-portfolio/tree/main/Airbnb%20Relational%20Database%20Design%20and%20SQL%20Implementation)

In this project I designed and implemented a normalized relational database modeling Airbnb’s marketplace operations. I built an ER model and translated it into 20 SQL tables with primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity. I also defined 10 real-world business problems and developed SQL queries to generate revenue, risk, and performance insights.
