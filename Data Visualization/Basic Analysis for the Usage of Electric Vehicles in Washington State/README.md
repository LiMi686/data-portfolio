# Washington State Electric Vehicle Analysis
This project investigates the usage and growth trends of electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington State by analyzing datasets from the United States government's open data website, data.gov. The project examines EV population growth, the most popular EV makes and models, county-level geographic differences, and which EV makes are likely to qualify for state tax exemptions. Various visualization techniques such as time-series line plots, bar charts, treemaps, choropleth maps, and word clouds are used to draw insights from data spanning from 2017 to early 2025.

## This project focus on solving these four questions: 
Question 1:   How does the population size of different types of electric vehicles in the state of 
Washington change, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles?

Question  2:  What makes and models are the most popular electric vehicles in Washington 
State?

Question 3: How does the electric vehicle population differ by counties in Washington State?

Question  4:  What  electric  car  makes  have  the  highest appearances in the list of potential 
eligibility for the tax exemptions in Washington State?
