# Washington State Electric Vehicle Analysis
This project investigates the usage and growth trends of electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington State by analyzing datasets from the United States government's open data website, data.gov. The project examines EV population growth, the most popular EV makes and models, county-level geographic differences, and which EV makes are likely to qualify for state tax exemptions. Various visualization techniques such as time-series line plots, bar charts, treemaps, choropleth maps, and word clouds are used to draw insights from data spanning from 2017 to early 2025.
