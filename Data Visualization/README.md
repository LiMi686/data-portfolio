<h1>brief introduction</h1>
<p>This project utilizes data visualization techniques to perform an in-depth comparative analysis of three significant pandemics in history: Cholera, Dengue, and COVID-19. The primary datasets were sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and underwent extensive data preprocessing and aggregation for analysis.</p>
<p>We employed stream graphs to effectively visualize trends over time for total cases and mortality rates of each disease, highlighting key outbreak periods and peaks. These visualizations clearly illustrated distinct seasonal patterns for Dengue outbreaks, significant spikes associated with contaminated water sources for Cholera, and the global spread dynamics of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Interactive geographic heatmaps were created using R's ggplot2 and Shiny, illustrating the intensity and distribution of pandemics across different regions and years. This enabled rapid identification of high-risk areas and provided insights into the effectiveness of public health interventions.</p>
<p>Moreover, we analyzed correlations between the frequency of COVID-19 news reports and infection rates using combined line graphs and histograms. Our analysis indicated a negative correlation, suggesting that increased media coverage potentially raised public awareness, helping to reduce infection rates.</p>
<p>Finally, radar charts were generated to compare critical epidemiological factors—incubation period, mortality rate, and illness duration—across the three diseases. This method effectively highlighted key differences: Cholera exhibited the highest mortality rate, Dengue had the longest incubation period but lowest mortality, while COVID-19 showed moderate incubation periods and longer illness durations.</p>
